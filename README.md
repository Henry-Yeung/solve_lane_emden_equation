# Projects description
Solving the Lane-Emden Equation. This project will estimate the dimensionless radius `ξ` that is corresponding to a range of polytropic indices `n` (from `n = 0` to `n = 4`).

# Required Python packages
The required Python packages: `matplotlib.pyplot` and `numpy`.

# How to run this project
After you have downloaded the file, unzip it and open the file in your terminal. Type `python Lane-Emden-equation.py` to run the project. The result will include the values of `ξ` (xi), the corresponding gradients and its `n` values (polytropic indices). The relationship between `Theta` and `xi` will also be shown as a separate graph (from `n = 0` to `n = 5`).
